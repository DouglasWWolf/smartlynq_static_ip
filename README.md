# smartlynq_static_ip

This is a utility for programming a static IP address into a Xilinx SmartLynq JTAG programmer.  To use:

(1) Download this repository.  

(2) Make *absolutely certain* that only one JTAG programmer is plugged into your computer!  

(3) Plug in a SmartLynq JTAG programmer via USB.   It should show an IP address on the top line of the screen.   If it doesn't, unplug the USB interface, and plug it back in.  It may take several tries before the SmartLynq shows an IP address.
